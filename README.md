<h1>Completion of a Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
During this profile activity, I undertook the task of completing a comprehensive controls assessment checklist, relying on the information presented in the scope, goals, and risk assessment report. This involved not only performing the controls assessment itself but also evaluating compliance and documenting the results in the provided activity document. This experience emphasized the critical significance of cross-referencing information and thoroughly scrutinizing the controls and compliance checklist.
